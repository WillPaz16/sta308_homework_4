# sta308_homework_4

The roulette code outlined in the sta308_homework4.Rmd has a few aspects to it.
First, we created a way to simulate a specific turn of roulette, using the 
sample() command. Then, we created a function that would simulate the number
of spins that occurred in a given day. In our scenario, we are supposing that
there's around 600 spins in any given day. But, the function also allows the 
user to choose a numerical value that can represent the number of spins in a 
day. Using the function, we looked at the difference between the average day
with 600 spins/day over approx. 4 years, and how it compares to 1,200 spins/day.
To display our results, we gave a brief statistical summary as well as graphical
representation of the data in the form of a histogram. I hope you enjoy the 
findings!
